Weyland-Yutani, the mysterious multi-national conglomerate, was pleased with their first foray into the Lyon market.  “We sold out almost immediately,” claims one company representative.  “We hope to continue to meet the needs of the citizens of Will World.” Many hopeful customers left stores disappointed including this reporter.  Perhaps local businesses will finally recognize a successful product and ramp up production.</div><div style="border-radius:1vw;background-color:hsl(45.0, 95%, 95%);font-size:20px;padding:2vh;margin:2vh;"><span style="font-size:16px;border-bottom:1px solid black;">Fri, 01 Mar 2019 01:05:38</span><h2>Amazing Mac Sales</h2>With a $1.91 price tag, stores had no difficulties in selling the latest macs.  To their surprise, Willians put aside their frugal ways and snapped up all the Macs available.   Wolfram and Hart, the massive Will World conglomerate was pleased with their sales of Macs, promising to increase production for the next cycle to meet customer demand. “If the people of Will World demand it, we will make it,” proclaimed Mr. Windham Price as he rushed to his town car after leaving the TBA disease fundraiser. Local business forecasters expect demand to remain strong through the next cycle.</div><div style="border-radius:1vw;background-color:hsl(90.0, 95%, 95%);font-size:20px;padding:2vh;margin:2vh;"><span style="font-size:16px;border-bottom:1px solid black;">Fri, 01 Mar 2019 01:00:41</span><h2>Retailers Revelling in Renewed Revenues</h2>After last year’s doom and gloom, retailers are thrilled with consumers’ renewed enthusiasm for spending binges.  “I haven’t had this many customers in my store in months,” said local shop owner, Dallas Royce. “We almost had a fight last week when we sold out of Lyons.” At this time last year, retailers were dealing with surplus inventories in clothing, electronics and other consumer goods. Now, they face shortages.  With the economy almost fully recovered from last year’s recession and corporate balance sheets flush with cash, salaries are beginning to rise and consumers are wasting no time in spending their additional income. “Last year was so difficult,” said Britta Perry. “I was laid off from my waitressing job and just about lost my apartment.  I finally found a new job and am rewarding myself with a brand new Mac.” Many customers are making similar comments.  Others expressed disappointment that stores were sold out by the time they got there.   Many manufacturers have indicated that they will increase production to meet the high demand.</div><div style="border-radius:1vw;background-color:hsl(135.0, 95%, 95%);font-size:20px;padding:2vh;margin:2vh;"><span style="font-size:16px;border-bottom:1px solid black;">Fri, 01 Mar 2019 00:55:42</span><h2>Energy Demand Up, Prices Remain Stable</h2>Jolted by an increase in demand, Will World Utilities is working to ensure they have the supply necessary to maintain their commitment to stable prices. “As a public utility it is our job to provide reliable, reasonably-priced energy resources to the citizens of Will World,” said Mr M. Scott, WW Utilities Representative. “We will do everything we can to meet the demand of our citizens and our business community without increasing prices.” Industry insiders say the utility does have capacity that can be brought online to meet consumer needs but if demand continues to grow at its current rate they may need to source energy from further away, resulting in higher costs to consumers.</div><div style="border-radius:1vw;background-color:hsl(180.0, 95%, 95%);font-size:20px;padding:2vh;margin:2vh;"><span style="font-size:16px;border-bottom:1px solid black;">Thu, 14 Feb 2019 00:35:59</span><h2>The Weather is Freezing but the Economy is Not</h2>After a turbulent few cycles, Willians are growing more optimistic about their future.  The economy is growing again and hiring for full-time jobs improved last cycle leading more unemployed Willians to increase their job search efforts. While unemployment remains higher than the government would like, spokespeople for the Roslin administration maintain that the economy is on track and that government stimulus programs are working. Retailers are hoping this growing confidence will be reflected in more open wallets and splurges at the cash register.  Consumer good sales were slow through the last two cycles as the recession and high unemployment made consumers cut back on their non-essential spending. The cold weather certainly didn’t help as many citizens opted to stay indoors, watching television and playing games instead of going to restaurants, shopping and enjoying normal winter activities. The Central Bank of Will World continues to monitor the economy closely, looking for any signs that consumer spending will fall again.  The Bank still has room to drop interest rates should the recovery prove to be short-lived. Not all Willians have shared in the growing economic pie.  Unemployment among high school dropouts remains stubbornly high.  Debate continues in government over possible options.  Suggestions cover all range of possible options from lowering or raising the minimum wage to increasing welfare payments and offering cash incentives to convince the unemployed to return to school to upgrade their skills.  Parliament remains in a deadlock and it is unlikely any new legislation will pass soon.</div><div style="border-radius:1vw;background-color:hsl(225.0, 95%, 95%);font-size:20px;padding:2vh;margin:2vh;"><span style="font-size:16px;border-bottom:1px solid black;">Thu, 14 Feb 2019 00:33:59</span><h2>Mega Corp Announces New Products The Macizoid The Lyonator The LM Supreme</h2>Mega Corp is pleased to announce the release of three new machines designed to meet the growing demand for Macs and Lyons.

We will continue our coverage of Mac mania here at Will World Words.</div><div style="border-radius:1vw;background-color:hsl(315.0, 95%, 95%);font-size:20px;padding:2vh;margin:2vh;"><span style="font-size:16px;border-bottom:1px solid black;">Wed, 13 Feb 2019 22:31:50</span><h2>Willians Seek Lyons</h2>The citizens of Will World have been on the hunt for Lyons.  Rumours of this new gadget reached the shores of Will World late last month but they have yet to have been spotted in stores.   Local businessman Barney Stinson, who claims he purchased one on an overseas business trip, says “they’re awesome” and will do wonders for your laser tag game. Unconfirmed reports state that DunderMifflin, a local paper manufacturer, is looking into expanding its business into the Lyon market.   Representatives from the company refused to confirm or deny the reports, stating only that “that’s what she said.” Visit Will World Words for further details as they become available.</div>
