<div style="border-radius:1vw;background-color:hsl(0.0, 95%, 95%);font-size:20px;padding:2vh;margin:2vh;"><span style="font-size:16px;border-bottom:1px solid black;">Wed, 17 Apr 2019 16:20:30</span><h2>Deaths at DunderMifflin</h2>In a tragic turn of events, a large migratory flock of Willian geese that flew over the smokestacks of the DunderMifflin died from their exposure to the toxins emitted from the factory. While CEO M. Scott initially denied any involvement in the deaths, the company couldn’t cover up the large number of bird corpses littering the company parking lot. Toxicology tests confirmed that the birds died after exposure to factory emissions. With non-stop coverage of the event in the media, DunderMifflin admitted that the deaths occurred on their property but say they are not responsible for the emissions. Instead, the company blames Mega Corp, the firm that designs and builds the manufacturing equipment. DunderMifflin claims that if the birds had flown over their competitors, they would be ‘just as dead’. “It’s survival of the fittest,” said Mr. Scrute, a DunderMifflin employee, “birds should know better than to fly over smoke stakes. Really, it is evolution. We should celebrate the fact that these birds will never reproduce and spread their inferior genes to another generation.” Mr. Scrute was dismissed from the company shortly after making the comments and is said to be undergoing psychiatric evaluation. Mega Corp claims that all toxins are within government accepted standards but they will review design specs and test all existing factories to ensure they are working properly. The events have put increased pressure on the Roslin administration to clamp down on the number of polluters in Will World. The booming economy has lead to increased air and water pollution as well as increased mining activities. Environmental groups and the Clean Earth political party have called on the government to pass stricter emissions laws.</div><div style="border-radius:1vw;background-color:hsl(36.0, 95%, 95%);font-size:20px;padding:2vh;margin:2vh;"><span style="font-size:16px;border-bottom:1px solid black;">Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:32:58</span><h2>Global Demand Pushes Unrefined Energy Prices Higher</h2>Expanding economies around the world are pushing up unrefined energy prices. Will World, without unrefined energy reserves of our own, has little insulation from global price fluctuations. Imports from the Island of Northernview and Lawrence Parkland have increased over the past cycles as new manufacturers enter the Lyon and Mac markets. Energy producers in Will World are producing at capacity and have no room to expand to meet increased demand. “This increased demand is definitely putting upward pressure on prices,” said Mr. Huile, an energy market specialist. “If the world economy continues its growth pattern over the next few cycles, energy prices will only increase.” Carter Burke, head of production at Weyland Yutani, did not seem overly concerned when contacted for comment. “Weyland Yutani has extensive experience in dealing with changing energy prices. We have hedged our energy contracts and do not expect a small increase in price to affect our operations.” Time will tell whether this is true for all manufacturers in Will World.</div><div style="border-radius:1vw;background-color:hsl(72.0, 95%, 95%);font-size:20px;padding:2vh;margin:2vh;"><span style="font-size:16px;border-bottom:1px solid black;">Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:31:46</span><h2>Lyon and Mac Markets Splinter</h2>What was once a predictable market for Macs and Lyons is no longer. With manufacturers increasing the advertising and showing off their business acumen, Willians are starting to show a preference for some company’s goods. “I love the Macs from Quad Inc,” said Robin Scherbatsky. “That company really knows what they are doing.” “You just can’t escape the ads from Lnda,” said Lily Aldrin. “They’re everywhere. I just had to buy one of their Lyons.” Other consumers were surprised to see more variety in the stores. “I hadn’t heard of OMAR Enterprises until I saw their products sitting on the shelf,” said Ted Mosby. Some Willians desired went unfilled. “I went to buy a Mac made by HBA but there were so few I couldn’t find any,” said bargain hunter Shirley Bennett. “They were sold out everywhere. So I tried to find one from Diatude and they were sold out too.” “It is clear that manufacturers are pursuing different strategies,” said one industry insider. “One firm is clearly going for volume, producing mass quantities and selling for a lower price while another firm seems to be holding production low to ensure a higher selling price.” The insider believes that the mass producer succeeded because several firms have chosen not to increase their production capacity. The insider was confused by some of the other firms’ strategies. One firm in the Lyon industry had the highest price but failed to do any advertising and few customers even knew that the company existed. Another firm increased its production capacity but failed to put in an order to produce on their new machine. The average price of Mac was $1.83 (with a high of $3.39 to a low of $1.50). The average price of Lyon was $1.37 (with a high of $2.00 to a low of $0.60). Many industry watchers agree that most companies are slightly under-pricing the market. With rumours of new products growing, it will be interesting to see what happens to prices next cycle.</div><div style="border-radius:1vw;background-color:hsl(108.0, 95%, 95%);font-size:20px;padding:2vh;margin:2vh;"><span style="font-size:16px;border-bottom:1px solid black;">Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:30:36</span><h2>How much more can we take?</h2>With rising prosperity comes rising filth. Most Willians will tell you they are happy with the economy improving and wages beginning to rise. Rising incomes give the hard-working citizens of Will World the opportunity to indulge and splurge on the latest in consumer products. Manufacturers have rushed to fill this demand, flooding the shelves of Will World with Macs and Lyons. But our shelves are not the only things flooding. Our air is dirtier than ever. Our natural resources are plundered in the name of cheap consumer goods. Can we live with this? Isn’t time these companies stop profiting from the destruction of our world? Now is the time for action. Now that companies can’t cry poverty or a poor economy, now is the time for all corporations of Will World to do their part. Call your representative and demand that the government take strong action. It is our children’s future that is at stake.</div><div style="border-radius:1vw;background-color:hsl(144.0, 95%, 95%);font-size:20px;padding:2vh;margin:2vh;"><span style="font-size:16px;border-bottom:1px solid black;">Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:20:32</span><h2>Minimum Wage Increases</h2>After a controversial parliamentary session, which saw disagreements dissolve into shouting matches on the house floor, the government of Will World has determined that the minimum wage will rise to $35 per cycle. This is the first increase to the minimum wage in 18 cycles. “With energy prices rising and the unemployment rate falling, it is time for all Willians to share in the expanding economy,” said a spokesperson for the Roslin administration. “Our minimum wage workers are the hardest hit by higher energy prices. They need some relief and our government is here to provide it.” Many labour activists praised the move while some said the increase was not enough. “If energy prices keep going up, this wage increase won’t have much effect,” said one labour activist. Business reaction was mixed as well. Many businesses said that in a time of rising energy prices they can’t afford to pay their workers more. Other businesses, whose customers were minimum wage earners, were happy with the announcement claiming that the increase in wages should increase their sales.</div><div style="border-radius:1vw;background-color:hsl(180.0, 95%, 95%);font-size:20px;padding:2vh;margin:2vh;"><span style="font-size:16px;border-bottom:1px solid black;">Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:20:04</span><h2>Nakatomi Trading Corp.

If you didn’t you are probably the only person in the country without one. With most Will World manufacturers increasing their production and one manufacturer alone responsible for just under half of the entire supply of Lyons, there were so many products flooding the market that retailers had to rely on discounts to move all the Lyons. “You make decisions based on certain market parameters, ” said Fred Burkle, Head of Research at Wolfram and Hart. “And then a bunch of newcomers go crazy and the market for your products bottom out. You don’t make much money when you are selling Lyons for $0.55!?” Ms. Burkle refused to comment further when asked about the potential supernatural retaliation. When asked about the price of $1.63 for a Mac, a company representative for Dunder Mifflin stated the company was satisfied with their revenue this cycle and would postpone a potential expansion into the market for beet juice. In related news, Mega Corp announced its most profitable cycle ever, with record-breaking sales. The company also said that it is reinvesting the profit into R&D and jet planes for company officials.</div><div style="border-radius:1vw;background-color:hsl(288.0, 95%, 95%);font-size:20px;padding:2vh;margin:2vh;"><span style="font-size:16px;border-bottom:1px solid black;">Thu, 21 Mar 2019 17:02:55</span><h2>Interesting Moves in Interest Rates</h2>In a surprise move, the central bank of Will World has dropped interest rates by 1.5 points to a new low of 4.5%. This drop in the overnight target rate will mean lower interest costs on new business loans. The central bank is hoping businesses continue to expand their operations, hire new employees and help the economy grow.</div><div style="border-radius:1vw;background-color:hsl(324.0, 95%, 95%);font-size:20px;padding:2vh;margin:2vh;"><span style="font-size:16px;border-bottom:1px solid black;">Thu, 21 Mar 2019 17:02:23</span><h2>Excitement Builds for New Mac and Lyon Options</h2>Rumours of new offerings of Macs and Lyons have Willians buzzing. Already a hit in Lawrence Parkland, the new painted Macs are expected to sell at a premium when they arrive in Will World. Prices in Lawrence Parkland average around $3.50. “I can’t wait,” said Annie Edison. “I’m going to buy five, one for every weekday.” The luxury Lyons, selling for around $6.75, now available on the Island of Northernview are also attracting considerable attention from curious Willians. “Quality is important,” says Jeff Winger. “I only buy the best so from now on I will only buy Luxury Lyons.” Market watchers are keeping a close eye on Will World manufacturers to see who will take the leap into the premium markets. It’s unknown yet how large the market for these new goods will be and how much of an effect this will have on the existing demand for Macs and Lyons.</div>
