While nothing we can do can restore these beautiful creatures to life, we will do what we can for other geese in Will World. We have started a fund to purchase nearby parkland that has been abandoned due to pollution and restore it to its natural beauty and create a preserve for wildlife. We encourage all Willians to donate to our cause and help create a better future for the geese of Will World.</div><div style="border-radius:1vw;background-color:hsl(36.0, 95%, 95%);font-size:20px;padding:2vh;margin:2vh;"><span style="font-size:16px;border-bottom:1px solid black;">Mon, 06 May 2019 18:10:54</span><h2>Dirty Air Leads to Dirty Politics</h2>In a surprise legislative session last night, the Roslin administration pushed through their new pollution credit system over the fierce, and oft-times vulgar, objections of the opposition parties. Through the legislation has been in the works for years, no one believed it would ever leave committee review. The deaths last week of flocks of Willian geese that flew through the emissions of DunderMifflin has added fuel to the toxic fire. The Modern Progressive Moderate Conservative party was pushing for no action, saying the market would solve the problem. “Just look at DunderMifflin today, “said one party member. “No one is going to buy anything they produce for years to come.” The Clean Earth party objected just as strongly to the legislation, calling it a ‘waste of precious paper that will do nothing to clean our air.” Party members had been calling for much stricter emission regulations and greater spending on pollution monitoring and enforcement. The Roslin administration settled for a program somewhere in the middle. Starting next cycle, all firms will be required to hold pollution credits, nicknamed ‘goosies’, to continue manufacturing. Either that or they need to find a way to eliminate the emissions from their factories. The details of the distribution of the credits are still uncertain but the government has promised an announcement shortly. While business groups are unhappy with the legislation, there is some relief that the government didn’t resort to the hard cap on production that was under consideration. Hopefully the system they design will allow for some flexibility,” said one industry watcher. “A hard cap benefits no one.”</div><div style="border-radius:1vw;background-color:hsl(72.0, 95%, 95%);font-size:20px;padding:2vh;margin:2vh;"><span style="font-size:16px;border-bottom:1px solid black;">Mon, 06 May 2019 15:19:59</span><h2>Painted Products, Pretty Profits</h2>It’s a great time to be a consumer in Will World. With the economy growing, wages increasing and manufacturers innovating, consumers indulged any remaining built-up spending urges. Products flew off the shelves and retailers said they sold out of much of their stock. If you wanted to buy a Lyon from Divitiae or Lnda you are out of luck. New products on shelves meant some shifts in buying patterns. One industry expert is warning that sales of standard Macs and Lyons may fall as middle-class consumers shift their spending to painted Lyons and Macs. “A sale of a painted Mac means one less standard Mac is purchased,” explained the expert. “As more painted Macs become available you can expect to see the demand for standard Macs to fall.” However, low overall supply in the Painted Mac market may mean prices and sales will remain stable. Some customers were overheard complaining about paying high prices for Lux Macs but, due to their limited availability, the company still sold out of all inventory. For now most manufacturers can celebrate a cycle with record-breaking sales and happy consumers. Willians are thrilled with their new painted Lyons. “They are soo pretty,” gushed Lilly Aldrin. “I bought five Painted Lyons from Diatude since they were so, so cheap. I thought about buying another from Lnda but they aren’t as popular. I splurged and bought a Painted Mac from OMAR Enterprises but I skipped buying a Lyon from HBA, way too expensive given how unpopular the company is.” Industry experts again that the Painted Mac and Lyon markets are experiencing significant shortages. This is actually helping producers of standard Macs and Lyons as consumers settle for the standard products when they can’t find a painted product. Lyons sold for an average of $1.46 with a high of $1.75 and a low of $1.35. Macs sold for an average price of $1.87 and had a larger range of prices with a high of $2.50 to a low of $1.40. Painted Macs were priced similarly, with an average price of $4.35. The biggest variance was in the Painted Lyon market with one company significantly underpricing its competitor by almost $3. Industry watchers are questioning the rationale of such a low price when demand for the company’s product is high. </div><div style="border-radius:1vw;background-color:hsl(108.0, 95%, 95%);font-size:20px;padding:2vh;margin:2vh;"><span style="font-size:16px;border-bottom:1px solid black;">Wed, 17 Apr 2019 16:20:30</span><h2>Deaths at DunderMifflin</h2>In a tragic turn of events, a large migratory flock of Willian geese that flew over the smokestacks of the DunderMifflin died from their exposure to the toxins emitted from the factory. While CEO M. Scott initially denied any involvement in the deaths, the company couldn’t cover up the large number of bird corpses littering the company parking lot. Toxicology tests confirmed that the birds died after exposure to factory emissions. With non-stop coverage of the event in the media, DunderMifflin admitted that the deaths occurred on their property but say they are not responsible for the emissions. Instead, the company blames Mega Corp, the firm that designs and builds the manufacturing equipment. DunderMifflin claims that if the birds had flown over their competitors, they would be ‘just as dead’. “It’s survival of the fittest,” said Mr. Scrute, a DunderMifflin employee, “birds should know better than to fly over smoke stakes. Really, it is evolution. We should celebrate the fact that these birds will never reproduce and spread their inferior genes to another generation.” Mr. Scrute was dismissed from the company shortly after making the comments and is said to be undergoing psychiatric evaluation. Mega Corp claims that all toxins are within government accepted standards but they will review design specs and test all existing factories to ensure they are working properly. The events have put increased pressure on the Roslin administration to clamp down on the number of polluters in Will World. The booming economy has lead to increased air and water pollution as well as increased mining activities. Environmental groups and the Clean Earth political party have called on the government to pass stricter emissions laws.</div><div style="border-radius:1vw;background-color:hsl(144.0, 95%, 95%);font-size:20px;padding:2vh;margin:2vh;"><span style="font-size:16px;border-bottom:1px solid black;">Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:32:58</span><h2>Global Demand Pushes Unrefined Energy Prices Higher</h2>Expanding economies around the world are pushing up unrefined energy prices. Will World, without unrefined energy reserves of our own, has little insulation from global price fluctuations. Imports from the Island of Northernview and Lawrence Parkland have increased over the past cycles as new manufacturers enter the Lyon and Mac markets. Energy producers in Will World are producing at capacity and have no room to expand to meet increased demand. “This increased demand is definitely putting upward pressure on prices,” said Mr. Huile, an energy market specialist. “If the world economy continues its growth pattern over the next few cycles, energy prices will only increase.” Carter Burke, head of production at Weyland Yutani, did not seem overly concerned when contacted for comment. “Weyland Yutani has extensive experience in dealing with changing energy prices. We have hedged our energy contracts and do not expect a small increase in price to affect our operations.” Time will tell whether this is true for all manufacturers in Will World.</div><div style="border-radius:1vw;background-color:hsl(180.0, 95%, 95%);font-size:20px;padding:2vh;margin:2vh;"><span style="font-size:16px;border-bottom:1px solid black;">Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:31:46</span><h2>Lyon and Mac Markets Splinter</h2>What was once a predictable market for Macs and Lyons is no longer. With manufacturers increasing the advertising and showing off their business acumen, Willians are starting to show a preference for some company’s goods. “I love the Macs from Quad Inc,” said Robin Scherbatsky. “That company really knows what they are doing.” “You just can’t escape the ads from Lnda,” said Lily Aldrin. “They’re everywhere. I just had to buy one of their Lyons.” Other consumers were surprised to see more variety in the stores. “I hadn’t heard of OMAR Enterprises until I saw their products sitting on the shelf,” said Ted Mosby. Some Willians desired went unfilled. “I went to buy a Mac made by HBA but there were so few I couldn’t find any,” said bargain hunter Shirley Bennett. “They were sold out everywhere. So I tried to find one from Diatude and they were sold out too.” “It is clear that manufacturers are pursuing different strategies,” said one industry insider. “One firm is clearly going for volume, producing mass quantities and selling for a lower price while another firm seems to be holding production low to ensure a higher selling price.” The insider believes that the mass producer succeeded because several firms have chosen not to increase their production capacity. The insider was confused by some of the other firms’ strategies. One firm in the Lyon industry had the highest price but failed to do any advertising and few customers even knew that the company existed. Another firm increased its production capacity but failed to put in an order to produce on their new machine. The average price of Mac was $1.83 (with a high of $3.39 to a low of $1.50). The average price of Lyon was $1.37 (with a high of $2.00 to a low of $0.60). Many industry watchers agree that most companies are slightly under-pricing the market. With rumours of new products growing, it will be interesting to see what happens to prices next cycle.</div><div style="border-radius:1vw;background-color:hsl(216.0, 95%, 95%);font-size:20px;padding:2vh;margin:2vh;"><span style="font-size:16px;border-bottom:1px solid black;">Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:30:36</span><h2>How much more can we take?</h2>With rising prosperity comes rising filth. Most Willians will tell you they are happy with the economy improving and wages beginning to rise. Rising incomes give the hard-working citizens of Will World the opportunity to indulge and splurge on the latest in consumer products. Manufacturers have rushed to fill this demand, flooding the shelves of Will World with Macs and Lyons. But our shelves are not the only things flooding. Our air is dirtier than ever. Our natural resources are plundered in the name of cheap consumer goods. Can we live with this? Isn’t time these companies stop profiting from the destruction of our world? Now is the time for action. Now that companies can’t cry poverty or a poor economy, now is the time for all corporations of Will World to do their part. Call your representative and demand that the government take strong action. It is our children’s future that is at stake.</div><div style="border-radius:1vw;background-color:hsl(251.99999999999997, 95%, 95%);font-size:20px;padding:2vh;margin:2vh;"><span style="font-size:16px;border-bottom:1px solid black;">Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:20:32</span><h2>Minimum Wage Increases</h2>After a controversial parliamentary session, which saw disagreements dissolve into shouting matches on the house floor, the government of Will World has determined that the minimum wage will rise to $35 per cycle. This is the first increase to the minimum wage in 18 cycles. “With energy prices rising and the unemployment rate falling, it is time for all Willians to share in the expanding economy,” said a spokesperson for the Roslin administration. “Our minimum wage workers are the hardest hit by higher energy prices. They need some relief and our government is here to provide it.” Many labour activists praised the move while some said the increase was not enough. “If energy prices keep going up, this wage increase won’t have much effect,” said one labour activist. Business reaction was mixed as well. Many businesses said that in a time of rising energy prices they can’t afford to pay their workers more. Other businesses, whose customers were minimum wage earners, were happy with the announcement claiming that the increase in wages should increase their sales.</div><div style="border-radius:1vw;background-color:hsl(288.0, 95%, 95%);font-size:20px;padding:2vh;margin:2vh;"><span style="font-size:16px;border-bottom:1px solid black;">Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:20:04</span><h2>Nakatomi Trading Corp.
