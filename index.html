If you didn’t you are probably the only person in the country without one. With most Will World manufacturers increasing their production and one manufacturer alone responsible for just under half of the entire supply of Lyons, there were so many products flooding the market that retailers had to rely on discounts to move all the Lyons. “You make decisions based on certain market parameters, ” said Fred Burkle, Head of Research at Wolfram and Hart. “And then a bunch of newcomers go crazy and the market for your products bottom out. You don’t make much money when you are selling Lyons for $0.55!?” Ms. Burkle refused to comment further when asked about the potential supernatural retaliation. When asked about the price of $1.63 for a Mac, a company representative for Dunder Mifflin stated the company was satisfied with their revenue this cycle and would postpone a potential expansion into the market for beet juice. In related news, Mega Corp announced its most profitable cycle ever, with record-breaking sales. The company also said that it is reinvesting the profit into R&D and jet planes for company officials.</div><div style="border-radius:1vw;background-color:hsl(72.0, 95%, 95%);font-size:20px;padding:2vh;margin:2vh;"><span style="font-size:16px;border-bottom:1px solid black;">Thu, 21 Mar 2019 17:02:55</span><h2>Interesting Moves in Interest Rates</h2>In a surprise move, the central bank of Will World has dropped interest rates by 1.5 points to a new low of 4.5%. This drop in the overnight target rate will mean lower interest costs on new business loans. The central bank is hoping businesses continue to expand their operations, hire new employees and help the economy grow.</div><div style="border-radius:1vw;background-color:hsl(108.0, 95%, 95%);font-size:20px;padding:2vh;margin:2vh;"><span style="font-size:16px;border-bottom:1px solid black;">Thu, 21 Mar 2019 17:02:23</span><h2>Excitement Builds for New Mac and Lyon Options</h2>Rumours of new offerings of Macs and Lyons have Willians buzzing. Already a hit in Lawrence Parkland, the new painted Macs are expected to sell at a premium when they arrive in Will World. Prices in Lawrence Parkland average around $3.50. “I can’t wait,” said Annie Edison. “I’m going to buy five, one for every weekday.” The luxury Lyons, selling for around $6.75, now available on the Island of Northernview are also attracting considerable attention from curious Willians. “Quality is important,” says Jeff Winger. “I only buy the best so from now on I will only buy Luxury Lyons.” Market watchers are keeping a close eye on Will World manufacturers to see who will take the leap into the premium markets. It’s unknown yet how large the market for these new goods will be and how much of an effect this will have on the existing demand for Macs and Lyons.</div><div style="border-radius:1vw;background-color:hsl(144.0, 95%, 95%);font-size:20px;padding:2vh;margin:2vh;"><span style="font-size:16px;border-bottom:1px solid black;">Thu, 21 Mar 2019 17:00:36</span><h2>Will Words to Sell Advertising Space</h2>Will Words will now offer space for two advertisers to run ads on the bottom of every story or our sidebar for an entire cycle.

Although some customers were put off by the somewhat high price of $3.07 per Lyon, others were thrilled to simply get a chance to buy one. Weyland-Yutani, the mysterious multi-national conglomerate, was pleased with their first foray into the Lyon market. “We sold out almost immediately,” claims one company representative. “We hope to continue to meet the needs of the citizens of Will World.” Many hopeful customers left stores disappointed including this reporter. Perhaps local businesses will finally recognize a successful product and ramp up production.</div><div style="border-radius:1vw;background-color:hsl(216.0, 95%, 95%);font-size:20px;padding:2vh;margin:2vh;"><span style="font-size:16px;border-bottom:1px solid black;">Fri, 01 Mar 2019 01:05:38</span><h2>Amazing Mac Sales</h2>With a $1.91 price tag, stores had no difficulties in selling the latest macs. To their surprise, Willians put aside their frugal ways and snapped up all the Macs available. Wolfram and Hart, the massive Will World conglomerate was pleased with their sales of Macs, promising to increase production for the next cycle to meet customer demand. “If the people of Will World demand it, we will make it,” proclaimed Mr. Windham Price as he rushed to his town car after leaving the TBA disease fundraiser. Local business forecasters expect demand to remain strong through the next cycle.</div><div style="border-radius:1vw;background-color:hsl(251.99999999999997, 95%, 95%);font-size:20px;padding:2vh;margin:2vh;"><span style="font-size:16px;border-bottom:1px solid black;">Fri, 01 Mar 2019 01:00:41</span><h2>Retailers Revelling in Renewed Revenues</h2>After last year’s doom and gloom, retailers are thrilled with consumers’ renewed enthusiasm for spending binges. “I haven’t had this many customers in my store in months,” said local shop owner, Dallas Royce. “We almost had a fight last week when we sold out of Lyons.” At this time last year, retailers were dealing with surplus inventories in clothing, electronics and other consumer goods. Now, they face shortages. With the economy almost fully recovered from last year’s recession and corporate balance sheets flush with cash, salaries are beginning to rise and consumers are wasting no time in spending their additional income. “Last year was so difficult,” said Britta Perry. “I was laid off from my waitressing job and just about lost my apartment. I finally found a new job and am rewarding myself with a brand new Mac.” Many customers are making similar comments. Others expressed disappointment that stores were sold out by the time they got there. Many manufacturers have indicated that they will increase production to meet the high demand.</div><div style="border-radius:1vw;background-color:hsl(288.0, 95%, 95%);font-size:20px;padding:2vh;margin:2vh;"><span style="font-size:16px;border-bottom:1px solid black;">Fri, 01 Mar 2019 00:55:42</span><h2>Energy Demand Up, Prices Remain Stable</h2>Jolted by an increase in demand, Will World Utilities is working to ensure they have the supply necessary to maintain their commitment to stable prices. “As a public utility it is our job to provide reliable, reasonably-priced energy resources to the citizens of Will World,” said Mr M. Scott, WW Utilities Representative. “We will do everything we can to meet the demand of our citizens and our business community without increasing prices.” Industry insiders say the utility does have capacity that can be brought online to meet consumer needs but if demand continues to grow at its current rate they may need to source energy from further away, resulting in higher costs to consumers.</div><div style="border-radius:1vw;background-color:hsl(324.0, 95%, 95%);font-size:20px;padding:2vh;margin:2vh;"><span style="font-size:16px;border-bottom:1px solid black;">Thu, 14 Feb 2019 00:35:59</span><h2>The Weather is Freezing but the Economy is Not</h2>After a turbulent few cycles, Willians are growing more optimistic about their future. The economy is growing again and hiring for full-time jobs improved last cycle leading more unemployed Willians to increase their job search efforts. While unemployment remains higher than the government would like, spokespeople for the Roslin administration maintain that the economy is on track and that government stimulus programs are working. Retailers are hoping this growing confidence will be reflected in more open wallets and splurges at the cash register. Consumer good sales were slow through the last two cycles as the recession and high unemployment made consumers cut back on their non-essential spending. The cold weather certainly didn’t help as many citizens opted to stay indoors, watching television and playing games instead of going to restaurants, shopping and enjoying normal winter activities. The Central Bank of Will World continues to monitor the economy closely, looking for any signs that consumer spending will fall again. The Bank still has room to drop interest rates should the recovery prove to be short-lived. Not all Willians have shared in the growing economic pie. Unemployment among high school dropouts remains stubbornly high. Debate continues in government over possible options. Suggestions cover all range of possible options from lowering or raising the minimum wage to increasing welfare payments and offering cash incentives to convince the unemployed to return to school to upgrade their skills. Parliament remains in a deadlock and it is unlikely any new legislation will pass soon.</div>
